### Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Be respectful and constructive.

### How to Report Bugs

Please use the **Bug Report** issue template. Include:
- Compiler, version, OS, and C++ standard used
- Expected vs. actual behavior

Avoid reporting bugs already fixed in the `main` branch.

### Suggesting Features

Use the **Feature Request** template. We prefer features that:
- Solve common problems in systems/utility code
- Align with modern C++ (C++17 or later)
- Have zero runtime overhead when unused
- Do not duplicate functionality in the standard library

We may decline niche or high-complexity proposals to keep the library lightweight.
