# Code of Conduct

We want this project to be a welcoming and respectful place for everyone, regardless of background or experience level.

## Our Pledge

- Be kind and considerate in your words and actions.
- Respect differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Focus on what’s best for the community and the code.

## What We Don’t Tolerate

- Harassment, personal attacks, or offensive comments (including those based on identity).
- Disrespectful or dismissive behavior toward others’ contributions.

## That’s It!

This is a small, technical project — we trust you to use common sense and treat others as you’d like to be treated. If something feels off, please reach out to the maintainer.

Thank you for helping keep this space positive and productive.
